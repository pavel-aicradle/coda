	"""This is the example given in the figures in the paper. I spent a long time toying with it, and I'm convinced
	it's just kind of not a great example. I only a few times succeeded in tuning lambda such that setting V6 as the
	outlier, which they give as the answer, results in lower cumulative energy than setting V2. The trouble is that both
	are fairly equidistant from the mean of their community (103), but the fact V2 is just as connected to the other
	cluster as its own, and V6 actually has more connections (both by portion and by absolute count) to the high-income
	cluster, means that V2 is sort of "pulled off" and has higher energy. I have no idea whether they actually ran
	their algorithm on their example and got it to work, but I feel like maybe they didn't.
